WebGIS Dashboard with React Leaflet, Clerk, and Postgres
This repository provides a comprehensive WebGIS dashboard application built with React, Leaflet, Clerk, and Postgres. It demonstrates functionalities essential for interactive geospatial visualizations:

Seamless GeoServer Integration: Leverages GeoServer's WFS API to fetch state boundary data for India.
Choropleth Mapping: Visualizes state boundaries with dynamic coloring based on dummy college data, making patterns and trends readily apparent.
React Leaflet for Interactivity: Employs React Leaflet for an interactive and user-friendly map experience.
Secure Authentication with Clerk: Implements Clerk for robust login functionality, ensuring data security.
Responsive Design for All Devices: Adapts the interface seamlessly across various screen sizes for optimal viewing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
Postgres Database Management: Utilizes Postgres to efficiently store and manage dummy college data associated with each state.
RESTful API for Data Communication: Provides a well-defined backend API to serve college data to the React frontend, enabling efficient data flow.
